**zser** (pronounced z…õzir like "Weezer") is a security-oriented serialization
format with novel authentication properties based on "Merkleized" data
structures.

## Oh no! Not another serialization format!

*[Obligatory xkcd](https://xkcd.com/927/)*

The decision to create a new serialization format was not undertaken lightly.
This format was created as a prerequisite of the [zcred] project, which
originally started as a Protobuf-based format ([protocreds]). Unfortunately
[protobuf limitations] made it difficult to implement zser's distinguishing
feature: Merkleized content authentication, while still supporting schema
evolution.

The wire representation of zser largely resembles protobufs, but with an
number of improvements including a self-describing structure, a UTF-8 inspired
prefix varint structure, and a richer set of wire types.

zser is not intended to be a general purpose serialization format: for that
we recommend [Cap'n Proto]. For example zser does not have an associated RPC
protocol, but rather zser is the sort of thing you might use for the
credentials passed as part of your RPC protocol.

zser's data model is isomorphic with a subset of [TJSON], a microformat which
extends JSON with richer types. All zser documents can be bidirectionally
transcoded to/from TJSON with no data loss. Furthermore, TJSON documents
can be authenticated with the same Merkleized hashing scheme as zser,
meaning signatures for one encoding will validate in the other.

## Comparison with other serialization formats

The table below compares zser to the other formats considered
(and rejected) for the zcred use case:
